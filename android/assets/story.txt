Wouldn't it be good, to look into a brighter day.
As years ago in days of old. When magic filled the earth.
We'd go wherever our minds will take us, way back when.
Now a memory remains, just a tiny spark.

Moon cat has turned earth into a mechanical, predictable world.
In this wasteland, there's no higher ground to stand than bottom of the pile.
When you can't really function you're so full of fear.
This is the end of the road, this is the end of the line.
That's just the way it is. Things will never be the same.

An orphan swims everyday in the same polluted mess.
In an old machine her parents preserved for fifty odd years.
Running away, never wondering why.
Her reserve a quiet defense: riding out the days events.
The river...
One fine day, in a long forgotten cave, she finds the carrier of the green flame.
It conferes the ship its powers.
"I can't wait to share this new wonder, the people will all see its light."
"There's something here that's strong as life, i know that it will reach you"
"Gonna run till my feet are raw"
"This day we fight"
*
She rides majestic
Past homes of men
Who care not or gaze with joy...
